Create the image in inkscape, export to PDF + LaTeX, then run
"lualatex page-layout.tex" and "pdfcrop --margins 2 page-layout.pdf".
Font size is a little exaggerated because we shrink the
image in the final document.

Yes, we could import the .pdf_tex file exported from inkscape
directly into the document, but that would be an ususual example
for casual LaTeX users.
